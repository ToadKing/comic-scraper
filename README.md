# comic-scraper
UserScript for downloading comics from comic websites. Works in Firefox (GreaseMonkey) and Chrome, no promises about anywhere else.

If you are downloading large comics with 100+ pages you want to make sure you're using a 64-bit browser. Otherwise you will probably run into memory issues.

**WARNING:** PNG downloads will create crazy huge files for even small comics, handle with care.

## Build
