# comixology-scraper
UserScript for downloading comics from Comixology. Tested on a grand total of one comic. Works in Firefox and Chrome, no promises about anywhere else.

No status on downloads currently because I'm super lazy. Messages are logged to the console for status and an alert dialog will pop up if some pages do not download.

## Build
```
npm install
npm run build
```
